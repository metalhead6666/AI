/**
 * Implementation of Q-best batch construction.
 *
 * Querying the Q-best queries according to some query strategy often does not
 * work well, since it fails to consider the overlap in information content
 * among the “best” instances.
 *
 * If only one (1) instance is selected, then the queries are selected in
 * serial, i.e., one at a time, corresponding to the most active learning
 * research.
 *
 * See for more information: Settles, B. (2010). Active Learning Literature
 * Survey (p. 67). Section 6.1.
